By “essential form,” it means that the factor solution extracted from an EFA should retain all important information available from the original data (e.g., between individual variability and the covariance between the construct under study and other related constructs) while unnecessary and/or redundant information, as well as noises induced by sampling/measurement errors, are removed. Stated differently, EFA is a tool intended to help generate a new theory by exploring latent factors that best accounts for the variations and interrelationships of the manifest variables (Henson &amp; Roberts, 2006). 2.utilizes reliability estimates 3.Promax V.S. Varimax: Promax” is one of the rotation methods that provide solutions with correlated components/factors (called oblique solutions). “Varimax” rotation method, which classifies items into components in such a way that the resultant components are orthogonal to each other (i.e., no correlations among components) (Pett, Lackey, &amp; Sullivan, 2003). PCA 1.is used to summarize the information available from the given set of variables and reduce it into a fewer number of components (Fabrigar et al., 1999) 2.assumes perfect reliability EFA operationalization Factor extraction method: PCA, PAF with estimated communalities (Thomas, Reio, Jr. and Shuck, 2015). Why is PCA an extraction method of EFA? They should be fundamentally different. Criteria for number of factors extracted: 1.Eigenvalue &gt; 1 2. Scree text 3.chi-square Rotation methods: 1.Orthogonal 2.Oblique Interpretation 1.Factor loadings (factor coefficients): the quadratic is the percentage of variance explained 2.Remove items that cross-loaded or those with loadings that were less than 0.33 Item response theory: account for the discreteness of the data EFA V.S. PCA 1.PCA -&gt; EFA -&gt; CFA (Matsunaga, 2010) or factor analysis is preferable to principal components analysis (Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005) 2.factor extraction (Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005) or estimation (Matsunaga, 2010): ML, PAF, PA. ML is the best if there is normality, if not PAF(Costello &amp; Osborne, 2005; Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum and Strahan, 1999) factor extraction methods, number of factors to extract, type of rotation to use, factor score estimation method, appropriate sample size, and handling missing data (Thomas, Reio, Jr. and Shuck, 2015): they are STATA: pf-principal factor; pcf-principle-component factor; ml-maximum likelihood factor 3.rotation Which comes first? 2 items no alpha? (Peterson &amp; Kim, 2012) Only CFA in papers, and secondary data, econometrics model, but even for survey data, why? 6.The last step: naming the factors The constructs were already built before taking the survey 7.What is commonality estimates? (Thomas, Reio, Jr. and Shuck, 2015). Bayesian: latent variable MTW Shared variance—caused by the factor or common method bias EFA: retain as many items as possible, need CFA in the next step Factor loadings cut-off: do not set up it as 0.3 Eliminate items • Eliminate poorly behaved items (indicators), such as: | Items with high loadings on more than one factor (i.e., cross-loadings) | Items with small loadings on all factors (i.e., low communalities) Rotation: why orthogonal? Where do the variances of factors come from? Why only reliability for two-item factors? "],["cfa.html", "Chapter 3 CFA", " Chapter 3 CFA Measurement equivalence: PSM? Randomness? Once the variance of factors become invariant, then go to the covariance between factors. Fixed effect?
